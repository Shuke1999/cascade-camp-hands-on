[Supplement—June 27,1861. whatever eccentric turns the Italian wheel of fortune may take iu making or marring the destinies of that singularly unhappy country. Liberalism is a creature that can accommodate itself to any clime or country; it can lead intense dissatisfaction into the heart of every Hungarian democrat j it can “ put up” M. Deal: and his followers to all sorts of democratic dodges ; it can oppose itself to the best principles of the Imperial policy of Francis Joseph, and it can afford food to feed the hungry, revolutionary appetites of the liberal press throughout the world. It can raise up a host of dissatisfied Hermans throughout the length and breadth of Prussia, who arc striving by every means in their power to damage the authority of the King and tiro Government. The military system of Prussia, as it has been termed, has been founded on an extensive militia system, and some of the greatest victories in Prussia have been gained by those who have enrolled into the army after this irregular fashion. The policy of the present Government of Prussia has been to raise and keep up a vast standing army, on whoso permanent power and strength Prussia may rely in her hour of need to defend her against the fierce attacks of Zouaves, Chasseurs, and Imperial Dragoons. It is the duty of Prussia to adhere and hold fast to her present military policy, and to tread down, with a firm foot and strong hand, all tendencies towards a revolutionary liberalism, come from what quarter soever they may. The Americans still continue to talk in loud, warlike language. Bluster seems to bo one of their national, normal, verbal institutions. If wo are to believe in half the threats they utter, nothing but ultra-annihilation of each other will suit their purpose. A few skirmishes have occurred among their outposts, in which the Federal cavalry (mounted on horses with very remarkable tails) have gained a very brilliant advantage over their opponents. Illness, sickness, and disease are the lot of all men. The Pope, who abjures matrimony and oonjugalism as mortal sins, has been suffering from erysipelas, and the Sultan of Turkey, who rejoices in possessing four hundred wives, and smokes thirty pipes of Latakia daily, has been also very 111, and is dead. Reports of his death have been current in Paris, and these have now been confirmed by electric telegraph.",

A seven days jury trial was concluded at Edinburgh on Friday laßt, in which Mr. Angus Macintosh, of Holme, a proprietor in Invernessshire, in possession of estates yielding him several thousands a year, sought £5,000 damages from Dr. John Smith and Dr. Lowe, proprietors of Saughton-Hall Asylum, a first-class private institution for the insane, on the ground of wrongous and illegal detention there. The detention took place so far back as from the 13th of June to the 20th of July, 1852, when, through connivance of one of the keepers, Mr. Macintosh succeeded in escaping. An action was brought against the defenders in 1853, but was abandoned, and a similar suit was at the same time instituted against Drs. Glover and Weir, who signed the medical certificate, and Mr. Hugh Fraser, writer to the Signet, who applied to the sheriff for a warrant for the pursuers confinement. On the 29th of July, 1859, after a five days trial, the jury returned an unanimous verdict that the pursuer was insane at the time, and was justifiably sent to the asylum and detained there. The present action against his custodiers was instituted °nly in May, 1863, and now came to trial. The jury were absent about three hours, and returned a verdict hy nine to three in favour of the defenders, a recent statute in Scotland enabling a divided jury in Scotland to give a verdict by three-fourths of their number alter three hours deliberation.

The Harrow-road was dotted with pedestrians, now single figures, now in groups of two or three, men who by their beards, their bearing, that special something which is at once recognisable to the initiated but which defies description, proclaimed themselves artists. Then cabs and carriages came rolling up the road, containing some of those faces the world is familiar with through the medium of the camera and the carte de visile shops-—literary men, artists, sculptors, actors, journalists. These were all dressed in black, and were all bound for the same destination—the great necropolis where repose the remains of many London celebrities, whither not a year ago nearly the same crowd was hastening to witness the sepulture of Thackeray. To this last event a reference was naturally enough in every mouth, for the dead had not only been Thackerays eaily schoolfellow, but his intimate and familiar friend ; men whispered to each other that one great reason of Leechs moving to Kensington was to be near Thackeray, and loving each other in their lives, it might almost be said that in their death they were not divided, as but one intervening grave prevents their dust from commingling.",

Mr. William Barnes, the Mayor, was called to the chair. The petitions have received about one thousand signatures, including those of several clergymen of the Close, and the Mayor and Aidermen and several of the members of the Corporation.

Hawker. —On Monday morning last, about half-past three oclock, an alarming fire broke out in the rick-yard occupied by Richard Leech, Esq. of Longparish. The Whitechurch and Andover engines, under Messrs. Hayter and Reding, arrived with a rapidity that did infinite credit to all concerned. But the barn, together with an immensely large oat-rick and a rick of vetches, then presented one immense blaze, so that the neighbouring pumps were all exhausted before the fire could be got under, and they were compelled to feed the engines from the river, distant about 200 yards, by means of backets. By great exertions, four other ricks, situated within a few yards of the property consumed, were saved, as well as the coach-house and stables, which last were twice partially on fire. The property destroyed, which is worth about £ COO, consists of a large barn, with above 50 quarters of barley, a cart-house, a boat, and various implements of husbandry. The flames were not completely subduea till four o’clock in the afternoon. The lire was evidently the act of some incendiary, Mr. Leech having received a threatening letter, a few nights previously. This awful event has excited the surprise of the whole neighbourhood, as Mr. L. is universally regarded as one of the best friends to the poor in the parish, and is looked up to by them as an example for imitation, on account of his liberal payment and extensive charities. Colonel Hawker was on the spot the whole time, and was indefatigable in his exertions. ;",

Great Britain and Ireland, from the Invention of Printing: with Bibliographical and Critical Notices, Collations of the Rarer Articles, and the Prices at which they have been sold in the present Century. By William Thomas Lowndes. London: Piceewno, 1828—9. Parts 1 to 7. We have long felt persuaded of the extreme utility, as well as pleasure, inherent in the study of bibliography. Amidst the mats of books, good and bad, which issue every year from the numerous presses of this country, it is .utterly impossible for those who live beyond the immediate sphere of the literary market, to form any idea of the comparative merits of different publications, without the guidance of a pioneer more experienced than themselves. Our principal Reviews are of some service in this respect; but besides the frequent partiality of their judgments, they pretend to go no further back than the current day, and give no information of the pecuniary value or external properties of the volumes they record. To understand the improvements made in successive editions, with the consequent depreciation of preceding ones, is sometimes a more important enouiry than at i first sight might appear. Hume materially injured his i History of England, by consulting, unconsciously, an imperfect edition of Whittlock’s Memorials ; and Robertson himself complains of the additional labour he had been forced to undergo in consequence of the imperfect state of the “ science of books” in his day. Some writers have pursued a subject, already made public,—while others have neglected the best sources of information, from the same ignorance of bibliography. But it is particularly to country readers, to those who can afford but a moderate library, and who would therefore wish to have all their little good, that a work of this nature must prove most requisite. They are protected by it from the artifices of dishonest plagiarisms and piracies, and are taught not only to distinguish between the different degrees of literary excellence, but between the qualities of various editions, their ptices, and peculiarities. Mr. Lowndes’s model is the famous “ Manual” of Monsieur Brunet, a work of amazing circulation in France; and he has admirably modified his original, to suit the circumstances of his own country. We have read the portion already published, amounting to somewhat more than half the entire work, with considerable attention; and are ready to pronounce it not merely the best, but the only effort of the kind worthy of notice, that has yet issued from an English press. As a book of general reference it is indispensable not only to authors, booksellers, collectors, but to every one pretending to, or desirous of, any acquaintance with the literature of his age and country. To know the contents of our best authors is a noble acquisition, but one of immense and laborious research : to know where to look for what we want, is almost as useful, and at least an important stage upon the road to learning.",

He rather thought the scarcity of the harvest had produced it. He did not believe that the present distress arose from the system of free trade ; for while the silk weavers were out of employment, so were the cotton weavers, and nothing new could be said as to the importation of cotton. Mr. H.

In addition to the improvement of the neat Marine Villar, situated on Greenhill, near Brunswick-buildings, which were preferred and occupied last summer by Sir Edward Hartopp and other fashionable visiters, it is worthy of remark that several have also been built near the read leading to the old castle.

In the Country, or (Jrondale-row, there were “Oft new pockets, and 1100 old, and old olds, making together 1150 pockets Country Hops. The prices may be quoted as under, for the early part of the fair, 1 amhams Irom X*lo to XlO per cwt.; hut at the conclusion of the fair many purchases were made from £lO to £ 12 per cwf., and in some instances as low as £t) per cwt. In the Country-row, from £ll to £lO ; but, as in the other case, at the early part of the tair. £l4 and even £lll was obtained in a purchase or two. Scarcely a sale was effected on Monday; on Tuesday business remained very dull; and on Wednesday night we may fairly state that twothirds ot the Hops then remained unsold. The growers intended standing over Thursday, after which it was concluded either to carry their unsold Hops home again, or warehouse them till Andover fair, in -November.— Cheese of the first quality, which this time twelve months sold at from 755. to 80s. per cwt., met a heavy sale from 555. to OOs. per cwt. —Horses were very numerous, and more business was comparatively done in this department than any other, though the prices were considerably less than those of last year—ln consequence of the line weather the pleasure fair was numerously and respectably attended.

The Silk Trade. —The letters received from Coventry on Wednesday mention that an individual who had for some time carried on business there as a riband manufacturer, and enjoyed good credit both in I.ondon as well as in Coventry, had. with his family, taken his departure for America. In a letter which he addressed to some of His London creditors, the party referred to stated that sucli had been the ruinous effect produced by the measures adopted with regard to the silk trade, and which had led to numerous compositions where small dividends were paid, that bis resources had been so much involved that he could not go on further, having lost since the beginning of the year £2OOO in bad debts.
