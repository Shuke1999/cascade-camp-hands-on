the	O

lias	O
issued	O
an	O
address	O
respecting	O
the	O

in	O

for	O
the	O
modification	O
of	O
the	O

system,	O
which	O

excited	O
a	O

ferment	O
throughout	O
the	O

The	O
memorandum	O
of	O
the	O
governor	O
appears	O
to	O
have	O
originated	O
in	O
a	O
refusal	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

to	O
allow	O
the	O
protector	O
of	O

to	O

the	O

to	O
three	O
of	O
the	O

of	O

nor	O
to	O
let	O

an	O

insinuated	O
by	O
the	O

in	O

that	O
the	O

POOLE	O
AND	O
ITS	O
PROSPECTS.	O
The	O
enthusiastic	O
and	O
unanimous	O
public	O
meeting	O
of	O
Wednesday	O
afternoon	O
last—a	O
report	O
of	O
which	O
appeared	O
in	O
a	O
second	O
edition	O
of	O
our	O
paper—is	O
one	O
more	O
proof	O
that	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
are	O
becoming	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
making	O
a	O
determined	O
effort	O
to	O
revive	O
the	O
trade	O
of	O
the	O
town,	O
and	O
increase	O
Its	O
commercial	O
prosperity.	O
Ever	O
since	O
the	O
Dorset	O
Central	O
line	O
was	O
projected	O
we	O
have	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
its	O
advantages	O
to	O
Poole	B-LOC
must	O
be	O
of	O
no	O
ordinary	O
character,	O
and	O
we	O
are	O
gratified	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
every	O
argument	O
we	O
have	O
put	O
forth	O
and	O
every	O
idea	O
we	O
have	O
expressed	O
is	O
in	O
a	O
fair	O
way	O
of	O
being	O
adopted	O
and	O
carried	O
out.	O
The	O
able	O
speech	O
of	O
our	O
esteemed	O
representative,	O
Mr.	O
Denby	O
Seymour,	O
fully	O
and	O
lucidly	O
expounded	O
the	O
exact	O
state	O
of	O
the	O
railway	O
acoommodation	O
of	O
Poole,	O
and	O
judging	O
from	O
the	O
applause	O
with	O
which	O
his	O
remarks	O
were	O
greeted	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
those	O
of	O
other	O
speakers,	O
there	O
appears	O
every	O
determination	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
to	O
support	O
the	O
Dorset	O
Central	O
line,	O
and	O
thus	O
show	O
that	O
the	O
allegation	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
sufficiency	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
accommodation	O
is	O
incorrect.	O
The	O
Treaty	O
of	O
Commerce	O
between	O
France	O
and	O
England	O
will	O
aid	O
considerably	O
in	O
developing	O
the	O
trade	O
of	O
this	O
port,	O
as	O
the	O
Dorset	O
Central	O
line	O
opening	O
up	O
the	O
coal	O
fields	O
of	O
South	B-LOC
Wales	I-LOC
and	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
course	O
make	O
Poole	O
a	O
depot	O
for	O
steam	O
coal.	O
As	O
Mr.	O
Robert	O
4lade	O
remarked	O
at	O
the	O
meeting,	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
estimate	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
advantages	O
the	O
treaty	O
will	O
confer,	O
but	O
if	O
any	O
line	O
or	O
any	O
port	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
bonefitted	O
the	O
Dorset	O
Central	O
and	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Poole	O
must	O
be	O
those.	O
This	O
sentiment	O
was	O
fully	O
endorsed	O
by	O
subsequent	O
speakers,	O
and	O
we	O
again	O
reiterate	O
it	O
as	O
being	O
founded	O
upon	O
a	O
correct	O
basis.	O
We	O
are	O
glad	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
support	O
I	O
rendered	O
the	O
Dorset	O
Central	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
substantial	O
character,	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
£lO,OOO	O
being	O
subscribed	O
in	O
four	O
days.	O
With	O
such	O
a	O
gratifying	O
prospect	O
before	O
us,we	O
think	O
we	O
may	O
safely	O
predict	O
a	O
career	O
of	O
future	O
prosperity	O
for	O
our	O
town,	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
line	O
is	O
completed	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
little	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
improvement	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
course.	O

able	O
officer	O
of	O

The	O
speaker	O
refers	O
to	O
imputations	O
which	O
I	O
am	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
made	O
(when	O
taking	O
the	O

of	O

as	O
to	O
what	O

put	O
was	O
this,	O
"	O
Inasmuch	O
as	O
the	O
safety	O

on	O

(as	O

the	O
Act	O
of	O

by	O
an	O

a	O

whose	O
business	O

?"	O
1	O
was	O
answered	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Tidd	O
Pratt	O
had	O
had	O
rules,	O
accounts,	O
and	O
all	O
before	O
him,	O
and	O
that	O
by	O
his	O
certificate	O
he	O
showed	O
that	O
the	O
tables	O
were	O
correctly	O
calculated.	O
That	O
such	O
is	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
the	O
registrars	O
certificate	O
is,	O
I	O
believe,	O
a	O
common	O
impression	O
and	O
a	O
common	O
mistake.	O
I	O
therefore	O
pointed	O
out	O
that	O
the	O
certificate	O
only	O
shows	O
that	O
the	O
rules	O
are	O
in	O
conformity	O
with	O
law,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
enter	O
upon	O
the	O
question	O
(on	O
which	O
all	O
safety	O
depends)	O
whether	O
the	O
tables	O
are	O
sound	O
and	O
fair.	O
I	O
further	O
pointed	O
out	O
that	O
the	O
certificate	O
says,	O
in	O
so	O
many	O
words,	O
"	O
The	O
rates	O
of	O
contributions	O
and	O
payments	O
are	O
not	O
stated	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
prepared	O
by	O
any	O
actuary."	O
My	O
question	O
remained,	O
"	O
Why,	O
if	O
(as	O
I	O
assume	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
case)	O
your	O
rates	O
are	O
well	O
calculated,	O
do	O
you	O
not	O
have	O
the	O
skilled	O
examination	O
aud	O
recognition	O
of	O
them	O
which	O
the	O

suggests,	O

you,	O

that	O

Mr.	O

upon	O
the	O

and	O
it	O
indeed	O
looked	O
not	O

on	O
the	O

We	O
observe,	O

that	O

Although	O
one	O

it	O

some	O
of	O
her	O

poetry—poetry	O
which	O
combines	O

with	O
extreme	O
beauty	O
of	O

and	O

to	O
the	O

in	O

It	O
must	O

reminds	O
us	O
of	O
the	O

"	O
There	O
is	O
but	O
one	O
method,"	O
says	O
our	O
contemporary,	O
"of	O
dealing	O
with	O
a	O
bully—namely,	O
that	O
of	O
setting	O
him	O
at	O

by	O
"	O
inexorably	O

them	O

their	O

This	O
is	O
very	O
good,	O
and	O
seems	O

it	O

Sir	O
James	O

he	O
was	O
anxious	O
to	O
press	O
upon	O
the	O

a	O
motion	O
occasioned	O
by	O
a	O

of	O
an	O

passed	O
last	O
year,	O
for	O
regulating	O
parochial	O
rates	O
in	O
the	O
town	O
of	O
Liverpool.	O
The	O
dispute	O
between	O
the	O
parish	O
officers	O
and	O
the	O

had	O
led	O
to	O
the	O
suspension	O
of	O

to	O
the	O
great	O
injury	O
of	O
the	O

The	O
motion	O

for	O

Mr.	O
Ellis,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
parish	O
officers,	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
distraining	O
for	O
poor	O

The	O
parish	O
of	O

15,000	O
of	O
which	O
are	O
rated	O
as	O
low	O
as	O
£12.	O
The	O
consequence	O
had	O
been	O
that	O
the	O
rates	O
were	O
seldom	O
paid	O
by	O
the	O
poor	O
occupiers.	O
The	O
act	O
of	O

of	O
this	O
application,	O
that	O
after	O
the	O
passing	O
of	O
the	O
act,	O
a	O
vestry	O

took	O
place,	O

a	O

made	O
;	O
but	O
instead	O
of	O
being	O
a	O
rate	O
for	O
the	O
poor	O

it	O
was	O
for	O
the	O
poor	O

county	O
rate.	O
The	O
owners	O
of	O
£12	O
houses	O
refused	O
to	O
pay	O
the	O
said	O
rate,	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
that	O
the	O
act	O
only	O
made	O
them	O
liable	O
to	O
pay	O
the	O
poor	O
rate	O
and	O
ecclesiastical	O
rate.	O
Having	O
resisted	O
payment,	O
they	O
were	O
summoned	O
before	O
the	O
magistrates,	O
who	O
decided	O
that	O
the	O
law	O
was	O
with	O
the	O
defendants,	O
and	O
therefore	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
issue	O

Sir	O
James	O
Scarlett	O
contended	O
that	O
the	O

to	O
absolve	O
the	O
owners	O

lessees	O
of	O

from	O
the	O
payment	O
of	O
county	O
rates.	O
On	O
the	O
contrary,	O
the	O
county	O
rates	O
were	O
always	O
paid	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
rates.	O
Lord	O

a	O

It	O
was	O
as	O

DESTRUCTION	O
OF	O
A	O
FUSTIAN	O
MILL	O
IN	O

A	O

a	O

and	O
one	O

of	O
its	O

last	O

destroyed,	O
and	O
its	O
valuable	O
contents	O
consumed	O
by	O
fire.	O
It	O
is	O
situated	O
in	O
Cable-street,	O
and	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
occupation	O
of	O
Messrs.	O
Henry	O
Williams	O
and	O
Co.,	O
fustian	O
finishers.	O
The	O
premises	O
were	O
stocked	O
with	O
goods	O
to	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
upwards	O
of	O
£20,000.	O
Considering	O
the	O
inflammable	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
stock,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
surprising	O
that	O
the	O
fire	O
should	O
have	O
spread	O
with	O
alarming	O
rapidity.	O
Behind,	O

the	O
the	O

night,	O
it	O
is	O
believed	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
range	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
destroyed.	O
There	O
was	O
another	O
difficulty	O
of	O
immense	O
importance,—	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
sufficient	O
supply	O
of	O
water.	O
It	O
is	O
said,	O
also,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
hit	O
eh	O
in	O
connecting	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
pipes,	O
which	O
occasioned	O

that	O

it	O
may,	O
Mr.	O

with	O
his	O
brigade	O
was	O
quickly	O
on	O
the	O

it	O
necessaiy	O
to	O

an	O

The	O

in	O

on	O
the	O

where	O
the	O
fire	O
broke	O
out—nobody	O
knows	O
how—and	O
in	O
trying	O
to	O
descend	O
by	O
means	O
of	O
"a	O
piece"	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
thrown	O
out,	O
he	O
fell,	O
and	O
sustained	O
severe	O
injuries.	O
The	O
flames	O
spread	O
rapidly	O
upwards	O

the	O

but	O
a	O
portion	O

the	O

rescued.	O

flames	O
raged	O
furiously.	O

of	O
water	O
from	O
the	O

flooded	O
every	O

the	O

hanging	O
down	O

making	O
his	O
way	O
among	O
the	O

seemed	O
to	O
be	O
looking	O
for	O
some	O

whom	O
he	O
had	O
remarked	O
as	O

in	O

was	O
n*t	O
above	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O

from	O
the	O

when	O
he	O
recognised	O
the	O

and	O
repeating	O
the	O
words,	O
“You	O
be	O
off	O

you	O
!	O
What	O

you	O

extended	O

inflicting	O
a	O

out	O
his	O

to	O

amidst	O
the	O

seized	O
him,	O
the	O

“puncing”	O
and	O

Murphy	O
took	O
no	O

in	O
the	O
latter	O
proceeding;	O
but	O
apparently	O
satisfied	O
that	O
the	O

By	O

When	O

to	O
the	O

the	O
man	O
in	O
charge,	O

them	O
;	O

they	O
told	O

states,	O
in	O

(St.	O

Day),	O
that	O
the	O
principal	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
damage	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
house.	O
The	O
windows	O
were	O
perfectly	O
riddled,	O
and	O
the	O

broken.	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
crowd	O
occasionally	O
from	O
the	O

window,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
dangerous.	O
There	O
were	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
of	O
them,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
riotous	O
and	O
tumultuous.	O
The	O
stones	O
that	O
came	O
in	O
were	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
twice	O
as	O
big	O
as	O

They	O
carried	O

into	O
the	O

and	O
still	O
they	O

on	O

from	O
the	O

Three	O
of	O
the	O

were	O
so	O
broken	O
as	O
to	O
render	O
it	O

that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
replaced	O
with	O

One	O

boasted	O
that	O

two	O

went	O
on	O

after	O

warned	O

the	O

amused	O
themselves	O
with	O
jumping	O
across"	O
a	O

Another	O

after	O

went	O
on	O

Another	O

of	O

The	O
most	O
remarkable	O
evidence	O
was	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
Secretary	O

the	O

He	O
proved	O
that	O
the	O

destroyed	O
the	O

for	O

life,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
police	O
were	O
powerless	O
to	O
protect	O
them.	O
He	O
applied	O
to	O
Sir	O
Richard	O
Mayne	O

Mr.	O
Walpole,	O
but	O
they	O
said	O
they	O

Mr.	O

told	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
be	O
prosecuted	O
for	O
taking	O
a	O
man	O
off	O
the	O
ice,	O
however	O

He	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O

to	O
clear	O
the	O
ice	O
by	O
six	O

in	O

in	O

Mr.	O
